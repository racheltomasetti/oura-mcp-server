# Oura MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Claude to your Oura Ring data, enabling AI-powered insights into your sleep, activity, readiness, and overall health patterns.

## What is MCP?

MCP is like a USB-C port for data and AI. Just as one USB-C cord can charge countless different devices, MCP provides a standardized way for AI systems to interface with diverse data sources. It structures the flow of data between applications and AI models, unlocking the potential of personal data streams to provide meaningful insights.

## Why Oura?

Your Oura Ring collects rich data about your body's rhythms, recovery, and readiness. This MCP server makes that data accessible to AI, enabling personalized insights and recommendations based on your actual physiological state.
